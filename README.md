# Cerrah Çırağı
Cerrah Çırağı is an AI using the linear regression model that is designed to predict possible mortality after a surgery used by real surgeons, it was originally made for my TUBITAK project.

The original data isn't present as it is not ethically nor legally possible for me to share the data but any data put in any model will result in succession, but it may vary from data to data reason such as low correlation, but that is up to the user to solve.

The report is published under the TUBİTAK - Deniz Lapsekili file, it is written in Turkish as per competition requirement.
